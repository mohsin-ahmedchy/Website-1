             <h2>Network Administration</h2>
             <p>One of the decisions during the installation of 
                 Windows Server 2008 R2 is the your server’s role and 
                 what features it requires. Server roles refer to the 
                 roles that your server can play on your network — roles 
                 such as a file server, a web server, or a DHCP or DNS server.
                  Features refer to additional capabilities of the Windows 
                  operating system itself, such as the .NET Framework or Windows
                   Backup.</p>

               <h2>Global Expansion Of The Internet: </h2><br>
               <p>All our charts on Internet
                The Internet’s history has just begun
                The Internet’s history goes back some decades by now 
                – email has been around since the 1960s, file sharing 
                since at least the 1970s, and TCP/IP was standardized in 
                1982.  
                The chart starts in 1990, still one year before Berners-Lee released the first web browser and before the very first website was online (the site of CERN, which is still online). At that time very few computers around the world were connected to a network; estimates for 1990 suggest that only half of a percent of the world population were online.
                As the chart shows, this started to change in the 1990s, at least in some parts of the world: By the year 2000 almost half of the population in the US was accessing information through the internet. But across most of the world the internet had not yet had much influence – 93% in the East Asia and Pacific region and 99% in South Asia and in Sub-Saharan Africa were still offline in 2000. At the time of the Dot-com-crash less than 7% of the world was online.
                
                15 years later, in 2016, three-quarters (76%) of people in the US were online and during these years.</p>
